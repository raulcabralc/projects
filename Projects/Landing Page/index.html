            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p><b>Ibanez guitars are often considered affordable for several reasons:</b></p>

            <p><b>Manufacturing Location:</b> Many Ibanez guitars are produced in countries with lower labor costs, such
                as
                Indonesia and China. This helps keep production costs down compared to guitars made in more expensive
                regions like the USA or Japan.</p>
            <p><b>Materials:</b> Ibanez often uses more cost-effective materials and components in their lower-priced
                models.
                While they maintain quality, the choice of woods and hardware can affect the overall price.</p>
            <p><b>Economies of Scale:</b> Ibanez is a large manufacturer that produces a wide variety of models. This
                scale
                allows them to reduce costs through mass production, which can lead to lower prices for consumers.</p>
